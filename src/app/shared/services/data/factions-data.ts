They could not avert the shutdown, but they did set out to re-establish contact with the disparate systems by sending out durable drones that could withstand the arduous journeys.nnAfter the Gates resumed function, their focus shifted to mapping out the network\'s changed layout and exploring newly discovered systems. However, they have not given up on the idea of getting to grips with Jump Gate technology and work out contingency plans, as a future shutdown cannot be entirely ruled out.',

      description: 'At the time of its inception, the Duke\'s Buccaneers was outwardly an officially sanctioned, non-governmental security outfit that operated within the New Duchy systems of the Paranid Empire. Behind this facade, a corrupt organisation began to form, determined to undermine the authority of the very government that had originally permitted its rise. The Buccaneers were led by the shadowy and cunning Pirate Duke who unified smugglers, pirates and other discontent denizens of this largely unexplored and unstable region under his rule. During the Terran Conflict, which forcefully distracted the Paranid Pontifex\'s attention, Duke\'s Haven was established as the faction headquarters in a newly discovered border system. That system was later grandiosely renamed Lasting Vengeance, presumably in honour of one of the Duke\'s driving motivations in the subsequent escalation.nnThe Duke\'s Buccaneers were infamous for requiring absolute commitment from their members, demanding that they cut all former ties, and sending them on dangerous infiltration and assassination missions against their former affiliates to prove their allegiance. For most of the faction\'s supporters, this made maintaining good standings with major political powers, or even pirate organisations, nigh on impossible, and over time resulting in them serving only the Buccaneers. Eventually, political tensions rose and the Buccaneers became hunted by their Paranid neighbours, leading to attacks on their headquarters itself. Regardless of the meticulous planning and seeming precision of those strikes, they never managed to corner or kill the pirate leader himself. The Duke always seemed to stay one step ahead of his pursuers, all the while giving his loyal subjects ample opportunity to make a profit in the ensuing chaos.nnAccording to the sparse pre-shutdown records, during a wave of warp instabilities between 780 and 782 NT, the Pirate Duke was on the verge of achieving his grandest scheme yet, when suddenly, the Buccaneers headquarters in Lasting Vengeance, and with it a large part of the admiralty, was cut off from the rest of the network. The faction as a whole, like many others at the time, dispersed quickly, with only a handful of small pirate bands continuing to vie for control of the now-isolated systems of the New Duchy. After the realignment of the Jump Gates, the Buccaneers were at first thought extinct. Though there were occasional supposed sightings in Paranid territory, these reports weren\'t given much attention, especially considering the much more pressing issue of the Paranid Civil War.',

It has, however, been theorised that something far less spiritual lies at the heart of their strategic outlook on the schism. Over the course of the last decade, entire economies have become reliant on the extraordinary military spending fuelled by this conflict, so it comes as no surprise that whenever the Faithful appear to be defeated, they\'re able to rapidly rebuild their forces with the support of anonymous donors from across the Jump Gate network.',

Some of them were able to slowly grow and prosper in relative peace and quiet, but others were forced to transform most of their sparse populace into warriors who engaged in a decades-long struggle to defend their homes against the similarly stranded Xenon matrices. Since the realignment, Kha\'ak can be frequently observed travelling the network, brazenly using the Highway installations, presumably in an attempt to reestablish a connection between their scattered hives.nnBecause their communication signals remain unintelligible, little can be established about the goals of the Kha\'ak as a whole. However, it is universally agreed upon that the Kha\'ak do, in fact, originate from beyond our galaxy and were drawn towards the network by Argon experiments with Jump Drive technology, probably coinciding with  an irrevocable deterioration of the Kha\'ak homeworld. It stands to reason that they are currently primarily focused on survival in an environment that largely considers them to be an unthinking scourge; a supposition that the actions of the Kha\'ak are yet to fundamentally contradict.',

Through its inception, the unthinkable geometric paradox of the two Pontifices has been remedied, and thus the Paranid Civil War officially brought to an end. Though there were numerous attempts to sabotage the negotiations, including a heinous attack on the construction site of the anonymously funded Sacrosanct Conclave, unity was ultimately achieved and defended by a most holy alliance of benefactors and proponents of peace. The political goals of the Trinity of Pontifices remain yet unknown, though it is universally expected that they will use their newly gained power to shift the political climate of the network towards peaceful coexistence.nnHistorical record: Godrealm of the ParanidnThe Godrealm of the Paranid is a theocratic feudal society worshipping the concept of the three-dimensionality. They refer to their ancient holy texts to justify their archaic power structure and pervasive authority. Although this Godrealm has been cut off from Paranid Prime, they understand themselves to be the true purveyors of the Paranid faith. After the Gates realigned, their strict interpretation of this faith resulted in tensions with the Holy Order of the Pontifex, and eventually, a civil war broke out. Still, the Godrealm maintains that the ultimate goal is not to exterminate the Paranids fighting for Holy Order, but to welcome them back into the fold.nnHistorical record: Holy Order of the PontifexnThe Holy Order of the Pontifex established itself as an authority on Paranid religious affairs and took control of systems during the tumultuous times of the Gate Shutdown. Their Pontifex is shrouded in mystery and defends this radical new interpretation of the Paranid faith with a zealous frenzy. The Holy Order is steadfast in their beliefs, which puts them at odds with the Godrealm of the Paranid. They do not wish to eradicate the Godrealm, but to convert them to their beliefs. Their fanatic attitude is less accommodating towards non-Paranid heretics.',

At this pivotal point, the Curbs decided that it was within their mandate, set out by the historical High Patriarch Ghus t\'Gllt, to curb not only their own Patriarchs, but Split society as well, by seizing power themselves.nBetraying their own Patriarchs, the Curbs secretly united into a separatist movement, targeted Patriarchs loyal to the Zyarth occupation, and attacked the Zyarth stronghold known as Hall of Judgement.

Frustrated with how the Commonwealth has, in their eyes, mishandled the Xenon, they have taken a much more proactive approach to engaging the Xenon across the network.

      description: 'The Yaki were an infamous organised crime syndicate operating mostly in Argon space, turning a profit by raiding traders and deliberately inciting chaos from which they then could benefit. They were well known for their professional and precise mode of operation, choosing their targets carefully and acting swiftly before any reinforcements could arrive. One branch of the Yaki Syndicate who were especially notorious were the Beryll, specialising in the theft and trade of advanced technologies. Their focus on near-AGI technology would inevitably put them at odds with the Terran government.nnDuring the Jump Gate shutdown, things quietened down considerably. Over time, Yaki raids became a less common occurrence. It appeared that different clans were splintering off and disappearing into obscurity. Even after the gate network was re-established, the Yaki were not as significant a presence as before.nnIt is now quite rare to spot Yaki ships. To the Community of Planets, it is currently unclear whether the Yaki have a fixed base hidden away somewhere, or whether their remnants are purely nomadic people, as they seem to disappear without a trace after what few raids they do still conduct. In fact, it is not even clear whether there is a coordinated Yaki organisation at all, any more, as their ships have been observed displaying wildly varying and erratic behaviours. All attempts at re-establishing official contact have failed, and on the scant occasions when a pilot has actually managed to communicate with a Yaki, the Yaki pilots\' behaviour could only be described as bizarre and their ramblings incoherent. It remains to be seen whether the Yaki pose a real threat to the law-abiding citizens of the network, or whether, in their current state, they are a mere shadow of their former selves.',
