In those most uncertain of times, they dedicated themselves to collecting the cultures and histories of all known species into their archives, fearing that the shutdown could result in that knowledge being lost forever.nnThey also threw themselves into researching Jump Gate technology in the hopes of reversing the shutdown. These attempts, unfortunately, bore little in the way of fruit. They could not avert the shutdown, but they did set out to re-establish contact with the disparate systems by sending out durable drones that could withstand the arduous journeys.nnAfter the Gates resumed function, their focus shifted to mapping out the network\'s changed layout and exploring newly discovered systems. However, they have not given up on the idea of getting to grips with Jump Gate technology and work out contingency plans, as a future shutdown cannot be entirely ruled out.',

    name: 'Duke\'s Buccaneers',
    description: 'At the time of its inception, the Duke\'s Buccaneers was outwardly an officially sanctioned, non-governmental security outfit that operated within the New Duchy systems of the Paranid Empire. Behind this facade, a corrupt organisation began to form, determined to undermine the authority of the very government that had originally permitted its rise. The Buccaneers were led by the shadowy and cunning Pirate Duke who unified smugglers, pirates and other discontent denizens of this largely unexplored and unstable region under his rule. During the Terran Conflict, which forcefully distracted the Paranid Pontifex\'s attention, Duke\'s Haven was established as the faction headquarters in a newly discovered border system. That system was later grandiosely renamed Lasting Vengeance, presumably in honour of one of the Duke\'s driving motivations in the subsequent escalation.nnThe Duke\'s Buccaneers were infamous for requiring absolute commitment from their members, demanding that they cut all former ties, and sending them on dangerous infiltration and assassination missions against their former affiliates to prove their allegiance. For most of the faction\'s supporters, this made maintaining good standings with major political powers, or even pirate organisations, nigh on impossible, and over time resulting in them serving only the Buccaneers. Eventually, political tensions rose and the Buccaneers became hunted by their Paranid neighbours, leading to attacks on their headquarters itself. Regardless of the meticulous planning and seeming precision of those strikes, they never managed to corner or kill the pirate leader himself. The Duke always seemed to stay one step ahead of his pursuers, all the while giving his loyal subjects ample opportunity to make a profit in the ensuing chaos.nnAccording to the sparse pre-shutdown records, during a wave of warp instabilities between 780 and 782 NT, the Pirate Duke was on the verge of achieving his grandest scheme yet, when suddenly, the Buccaneers headquarters in Lasting Vengeance, and with it a large part of the admiralty, was cut off from the rest of the network. The faction as a whole, like many others at the time, dispersed quickly, with only a handful of small pirate bands continuing to vie for control of the now-isolated systems of the New Duchy. After the realignment of the Jump Gates, the Buccaneers were at first thought extinct. Though there were occasional supposed sightings in Paranid territory, these reports weren\'t given much attention, especially considering the much more pressing issue of the Paranid Civil War.',

According to their official propaganda, they pursue a conviction which is shared by a significant proportion of the Paranid populace: that the Paranid Civil War - originating from the fundamental geometric imperfection of the duality of Pontifices - can only truly be resolved through the utter annihilation of the opposing faith. It has, however, been theorised that something far less spiritual lies at the heart of their strategic outlook on the schism. Over the course of the last decade, entire economies have become reliant on the extraordinary military spending fuelled by this conflict, so it comes as no surprise that whenever the Faithful appear to be defeated, they\'re able to rapidly rebuild their forces with the support of anonymous donors from across the Jump Gate network.',

Through its inception, the unthinkable geometric paradox of the two Pontifices has been remedied, and thus the Paranid Civil War officially brought to an end. Though there were numerous attempts to sabotage the negotiations, including a heinous attack on the construction site of the anonymously funded Sacrosanct Conclave, unity was ultimately achieved and defended by a most holy alliance of benefactors and proponents of peace. The political goals of the Trinity of Pontifices remain yet unknown, though it is universally expected that they will use their newly gained power to shift the political climate of the network towards peaceful coexistence.nnHistorical record: Godrealm of the ParanidnThe Godrealm of the Paranid is a theocratic feudal society worshipping the concept of the three-dimensionality. They refer to their ancient holy texts to justify their archaic power structure and pervasive authority. Although this Godrealm has been cut off from Paranid Prime, they understand themselves to be the true purveyors of the Paranid faith. After the Gates realigned, their strict interpretation of this faith resulted in tensions with the Holy Order of the Pontifex, and eventually, a civil war broke out. Still, the Godrealm maintains that the ultimate goal is not to exterminate the Paranids fighting for Holy Order, but to welcome them back into the fold.nnHistorical record: Holy Order of the PontifexnThe Holy Order of the Pontifex established itself as an authority on Paranid religious affairs and took control of systems during the tumultuous times of the Gate Shutdown. Their Pontifex is shrouded in mystery and defends this radical new interpretation of the Paranid faith with a zealous frenzy. The Holy Order is steadfast in their beliefs, which puts them at odds with the Godrealm of the Paranid. They do not wish to eradicate the Godrealm, but to convert them to their beliefs. Their fanatic attitude is less accommodating towards non-Paranid heretics.',

To combat the worst excesses of male Split enthusiasm, he set up the position of "Curb", a female advisory role to work alongside male warriors and decision-makers. While some families later abandoned this function in their communities, others still employ Curbs to the present day.nAfter the Free Families failed to completely unite and fend off the invasion by the Zyarth Patriarchy at the Fires, the Curbs of the Free Families attributed this failure to the Patriarchs\' irrational nature. At this pivotal point, the Curbs decided that it was within their mandate, set out by the historical High Patriarch Ghus t\'Gllt, to curb not only their own Patriarchs, but Split society as well, by seizing power themselves.nBetraying their own Patriarchs, the Curbs secretly united into a separatist movement, targeted Patriarchs loyal to the Zyarth occupation, and attacked the Zyarth stronghold known as Hall of Judgement.

Separated from the network, their economy thrived and the Terran Protectorate fortified their presence in Sol. Critics of the Terran government have claimed that establishing the Protectorate was merely an attempt to re-brand the USC, and that the underlying structural problems remained. However, there is no disputing that the Terran Protectorate does now operate differently from its predecessors. Not only is the Protectorate extremely zealous in its defence of the inner core of Sol, to the point where not even all Terran citizens are allowed to approach Earth, but they are also heavily involved in Sol\'s external relations. Frustrated with how the Commonwealth has, in their eyes, mishandled the Xenon, they have taken a much more proactive approach to engaging the Xenon across the network. Fleets are regularly sent out to ensure that Xenon pockets are eradicated, without regard for the sovereignty of the space in question. Nor do they shy away from actively trying to meddle in other governments\' affairs in order to influence their stance on AGI technology.

To the Community of Planets, it is currently unclear whether the Yaki have a fixed base hidden away somewhere, or whether their remnants are purely nomadic people, as they seem to disappear without a trace after what few raids they do still conduct. In fact, it is not even clear whether there is a coordinated Yaki organisation at all, any more, as their ships have been observed displaying wildly varying and erratic behaviours. All attempts at re-establishing official contact have failed, and on the scant occasions when a pilot has actually managed to communicate with a Yaki, the Yaki pilots\' behaviour could only be described as bizarre and their ramblings incoherent.

    description: 'Before the Windfall system became connected to Avarice, and later the network at large, the Vigor Syndicate used to be made up of smaller criminal organisations. They quarrelled amongst themselves almost as much as they antagonised outsiders and the common citizens of Windfall. These smaller outfits mostly made money by offering security services to the large, wealthy gambling institutions, by running their own high-stakes games, and by manufacturing and trading illicit substances. The time spent in isolation was chaotic and violent, but the absence of any organised law enforcement also provided ample opportunities to get incredibly rich with comparatively little effort. Maintaining that wealth amid all the other cut-throats was the bigger challenge, and the reason why these smaller groups eventually banded together.nnThe Vigor Syndicate was not the only semi-organised criminal enterprise to arise out of this unstable but prolific environment, but ultimately it would be the one to assert itself. Its power and influence grew when contact with the people of Avarice was established. With no-one to oppose them, they soon began to exploit the Riptide Rakers by offering them predatory loans, and methodically nurturing industrial dependencies among their destitute neighbours.nnNow, although there still is no clearly identifiable leadership and back-stabbings are still a regular occurrence, the organisation has grown to such a size that it has stabilised and effectively presents a united front to the outside. With Windfall now connected to both Argon and Teladi space, the Syndicate has fully consolidated in order to project enough power to keep other organisations out of Windfall. They keep the law away, and offer unscrupulous entities the space in which to grow however they see fit; as long as the Vigor Syndicate gets their cut, of course.',

    name: 'Riptide Rakers',
    description: 'The Riptide Rakers are a loose collective of miners, traders and scavengers, perpetually down on their luck and struggling to ensure their continued existence. Their way of life has been forged by the hostile environments of the Avarice system. Largely disorganised, and without any military capabilities, they do not pose a threat to any of the other inhabitants of the Jump Gate network; nor would they want to, since they are entirely focused on their own survival.nnBeing extremely resourceful, the Riptide Rakers have specialised in scrapping wrecked ships and other space debris commonly found in and around Avarice. Ingeniously making use of the exceptional stellar properties of Avarice, they are uniquely capable of maintaining an economy almost entirely focussed on recycling and reusing materials. Since they are generally on good terms with the other groups inhabiting the network, they have taken to dismantling wrecks and trading their recycled materials on a larger scale, ever since their gate re-established a connection.nnTheir resourcefulness and resilience is only matched by their stubbornness. Despite regularly suffering from the impact of the Tide, they stoically continue to live under the hazardous circumstances that make their large scale operations possible. In recent years they have found ways to shelter from the most devastating effects of the phenomenon, but stranded ships and the occasional station are still tragically annihilated. Many inhabitants of the network wonder why the Riptide Rakers would expose themselves to these dangers, but if you asked a Riptide Raker, the answer would be quite simple. They have become numb to the dangers of Avarice. It is their way of life, they will tell you, and they really just have nowhere else to go.',

    description: 'If you were to single out one feature that makes the Queendom of Boron stand out from any other entity in the known network it would be its serene stability. Notoriously pacifist in nature, the Queendom perpetually works towards the greater good by advancing its knowledge of the sciences, and furthering inter-species understanding. Due to their innate trustworthiness, Queendom officials are often employed as peace-brokers by conflicting parties. However, it is also important to note that their inherently conflict-avoidant nature does not mean that they will fail to defend themselves when attacked. They boast an impressive arsenal of weapon technologies, afforded to them by their comparative wealth and scientific accomplishment.nnAs the name implies, the Queendom of Boron is headed by a queen, currently Queen Polypheides. Although Princess Celeus is the current heir, the succession is not strictly matrilineal. Non-royal Boron could theoretically ascend to the throne if they were to distinguish themselves through their actions and prove themselves to be the most capable leader. Counterintuitively, while the Queendom is reigned over by a monarch, it is still a democracy, overseen by a parliament of elected officials who vote on all policy and succession-related matters.',
